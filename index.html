      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Despite the recent ceasefire between Hamas and Israel, Palestinians in Gaza continue to face a dire humanitarian crisis that necessitates sustained international assistance. 
        This website provides support, verified information, and educational resources for understanding and aiding Palestine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even with a ceasefire, the effects of prolonged conflict remain devastating. Many families have lost their homes, access to clean water and electricity is limited, and essential infrastructure has been severely damaged. 
        Food insecurity is widespread, and hospitals are overwhelmed. Children and vulnerable communities continue to face psychological trauma and disrupted education. 
        Because of these challenges, ongoing awareness, aid, and solidarity are crucial to support recovery and help rebuild lives in Gaza and the West Bank.

    <section id="events">
      <h2>Current Situation</h2>
      <p>
        In Gaza, over two million people live under severe blockade conditions. Rebuilding efforts are slow due to restrictions on materials and the destruction of essential infrastructure. 
        Hospitals continue to face shortages of fuel, medicine, and clean water. Displacement remains a major issue, with many families living in temporary shelters or overcrowded conditions.  
      </p>
      <p>
        International efforts are ongoing to bring humanitarian supplies into Gaza, but access remains limited. Education systems, health services, and employment opportunities have been disrupted, leaving many people dependent on aid for survival.
